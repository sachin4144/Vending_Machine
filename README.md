# Vending_Machine
Vending Machine FSM using Verilog

– Designed and implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog to simulate a digital vending machine accepting
Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 coins for three product options.
– Developed synchronous state transition and output logic based on user inputs, with appropriate change return and
reset functionality.
– Created a comprehensive testbench to simulate various transaction scenarios and verify functionality in Vivado.
– Handled edge cases such as user cancellation, no product selection, and excess balance return using a clocked
always block with reset logic.
– Tools Used: Xilinx Vivado, Verilog HDL, Digital Simulation, RTL Design
